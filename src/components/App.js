          <p>Moved to Austin from New England (could not take those winters anymore)</p>
          <p>over two years ago and now happy to call ATX home.</p><br></br>

          <p>I am a front end web developer, recently graduated from a fullstack program</p>
          <p>at The Iron Yard and was introduced to React. I devote my time to creating</p>
          <p>engaging, attractive, and user-friendly sites. I found my way to</p>
          <p> coding through diverse career paths from social work to</p>
          <p>project management. I have a passion for social causes and hope to use</p>
          <p>my skills to benefit and do pro-bono work for certain organizations.</p><br></br>

          <p>When Iâ€™m not in front of the terminal, I am reading (my ideal home is a library),</p>
          <p>dancing, volunteering, or enjoying what Austin has to offer. Exploring Austin includes</p>
          <p>finding coffee shops in which to read or code. Come join me for a cup of java! (see what I did there?)</p>
