- Scaffolded using react, but do not have dynamic content yet.

15-21 October 2017:
a. Created components
b. Styled header and body text
c. Offline working on content for bio, process, and projects sections

25 October 2017
a. Added bio and learned how to use an apostrophe in React
b. Nav bar was vertical on left, but switched to horizontal underneath header. Trying to decide which is easier for users (I like vertical and on the left)
c. Learned to do accents:
   i. highlight letter where accent needs to be
   ii. press option+e and accent will appear (default can be changed to other accents as needed)
   iii. enter the letter

Completed:
- Add pic: 27 October 2017: remember to put all files and directories in SRC!
- Upload Resume: pdf uploaded
- Complete contact info: added icons for li, gh, & medium in footer, added email to footer, on contact page added medium, updated auto email with subject line
- Added two project pics and one line description of projects.
- Added text and images to My Approach page, but age is not rendering at all?

Still To do:
1. Resume: Same to turn pdf into a png to post to this page.
2. Projects: add robots, add more explanation to all 3, re-size image and style layout
3. Process explanation: Why isn't it displaying? Add downloadable versions of the list and spreadsheets
4. Domain not displaying. Followed steps to add cname record in hover and still not working. Check 24 hours after setting up.
