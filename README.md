- Scaffolded using react, but do not have dynamic content yet.

15-21 October 2017:
a. Created components
b. Styled header and body text
c. Offline working on content for bio, process, and projects sections

25 October 2017
a. Added bio and learned how to use an apostrophe in React
b. Nav bar was vertical on left, but switched to horizontal underneath header. Trying to decide which is easier for users (I like vertical and on the left)
c. Learned to do accents:
   i. highlight letter where accent needs to be
   ii. press option+e and accent will appear (default can be changed to other accents as needed)
   iii. enter the letter
